# Object-Detection-using-SVM-Support-Vector-Machine-in-Python
Object Detection using SVM is a machine learning-based project that identifies and locates objects within an image using the Support Vector Machine algorithm. This approach leverages feature extraction techniques like HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) to represent images as numerical data, which the SVM model can classify.
